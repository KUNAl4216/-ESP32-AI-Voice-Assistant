ESP32 Real-Time Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech System with SD Card Support
This project utilizes the ESP32 to enable real-time Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) functionalities using Deepgram and gemini APIs. Additionally, it supports SD card storage, allowing voice recordings and conversation logs to be saved for future playback or analysis.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts voice into text using Deepgram API.
✅ gemini Integration: Processes user input and generates intelligent responses.
✅ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts gemini responses into voice using Deepgram TTS.
✅ ESP32 Support: Runs efficiently on an ESP32 microcontroller.
✅ WiFi Connectivity: Enables communication with APIs over the internet.
✅ SD Card Storage: Saves voice recordings and conversation logs.
✅ Low Latency: Ensures fast response times for real-time conversations.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements
ESP32 microcontroller
Microphone module (for capturing audio input)
Speaker (for playing audio output)
MicroSD Card Module (SPI-based for storage)
MicroSD Card (FAT32 format, min 8GB recommended)
Power source (USB or battery)
🔧 Software Requirements
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
ESP32 Board Package
Deepgram API Key (for Speech-to-Text)
OpenAI API Key (for gemini processing)
WiFi Credentials (SSID & Password)
SD Card Library for ESP32
📌 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/KUNAl4216/-ESP32-AI-Voice-Assistant.git
cd ESP32-AI-Voice-Assistant
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have installed the following libraries in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO:

ESP32_SD.h (For SD card functionality)
SPI.h (For SD card SPI communication)
WiFi.h (For internet connectivity)
3️⃣ Configure API Keys & SD Card
Modify the config.h file and add your credentials:

cpp
Copy
Edit
#define WIFI_SSID "YourWiFiName"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "YourWiFiPassword"
#define DEEPGRAM_API_KEY "YourDeepgramAPIKey"
#define OPENAI_API_KEY "YourOpenAIAPIKey"

// Define SD Card CS pin
#define SD_CS 5  // Change to your actual SD card module's CS pin
4️⃣ Upload Code to ESP32
Connect your ESP32 via USB.
Select the correct COM port in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
Compile & upload the code.
📡 How It Works (Now With SD Card Storage)
1️⃣ Voice input is captured by the microphone.
2️⃣ The audio is saved to the SD card for later playback.
3️⃣ Audio is sent to Deepgram API for Speech-to-Text conversion.
4️⃣ The transcribed text is sent to gemini API, generating a response.
5️⃣ The response text is sent to Deepgram TTS for Text-to-Speech conversion.
6️⃣ The generated voice output is saved on the SD card.
7️⃣ The ESP32 plays the generated audio through the speaker.

recording_x.wav	Stores recorded user speech (raw audio)
response_x.wav	Stores gemini-generated speech (TTS output)
conversation_log.txt	Logs full conversation (text format)
📌 Future Enhancements
✅ Improve storage efficiency with compressed audio formats
✅ Implement real-time playback from SD card
✅ Add voice recognition to identify different users
✅ Support offline Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech models
